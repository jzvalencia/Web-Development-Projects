 <h1>The Best Albums According to Jazz</h1>
    <h2>My top 4 albums of all-time</h2>
    <hr>

        <h3>Since I Left you - The Avalanches</h3>
        <p>Simply perfect album. Experimental yet so catchy, experimental but truly danceable</p>

        <h3>Soundtracks for the Blind - Swans</h3>
        <p>A round-view of the human condition thorough painful experiences. A nightmare made music</p>

        <h3>Leaves Turn Inside you - Unwound</h3>
        <p>The only bad part is it needed more strings. </p>

        <h3>Ascension - John Coltrane</h3>
        <p>Brilliant and beautifully wild. The perfect representation of the free-jazz movement</p>
